<p>I am delighted to be a part of this fast growing institute, which is making positive ripples in a serene location nestled in the midst of lush green ambience at Charathe, Sawantwadi, evolving high quality engineers. It is also located close to the industrial area of Goa facilitating industrial visits and placements in core engineering companies.

<p>At Yashwantrao Bhonsale Polytechnic, we have designed a holistic education pedagogy where the students are able to excel not only in education but also in the field of sports and culture. They are also exposed to the rich cultural heritage of our country. We have inducted an innovative project-based learning method in which the students are made to put the theory into practice thereby enabling them to understand the subjects more thoroughly. The creative energy of the students is unleashed in this evolutionary engineering process.

<p>The innovative teaching techniques that are developed and implemented by our faculty members are sure to bring a positive transformation into the young minds of the students, enabling them to attract good campus placements. In addition to this, the diverse collaborative MOUs with leading corporate houses are adding immense value to the students and also makes them industry ready right from day one of their graduation.
